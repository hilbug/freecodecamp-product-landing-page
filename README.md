# Product Landing Page - Sunny Travel Company

## Project Details
Created for freecodecamp.org's certificate [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). 
This is project <b>Build a Product Landing Page</b>. 

For certificate credit, I submitted a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/hilbug/full/bGgQMqM). 
Also deployed to GitHub pages [here](https://hilbug.github.io/freecodecamp-product-landing-page/).

I build pretty much everything with Bootstrap but decided to go outside my comfort zone here and instead used vanilla CSS based on Flexbox. 
There are still a few quirks I am trying to iron out for small screens. You can see this by selecting iPhone X in the inspector:
* ~~nav-bar button text is wrapping so it looks sliced in half~~ fixed!
* ~~nav-bar buttons are not stacking~~ fixed!
* ~~header log & text is not centering~~ fixed!
* ~~Lessen the space on either side of the “about us” paragraph~~ fixed
* Figure out a better way to space out footer-links so it’s centered
